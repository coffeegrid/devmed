$ what?
This is the source code of http://devmed.sh

$ why?
For fun

$ so?
So you can create new commands for the web shell and have more fun

$ seriously?
Yeah, why not? /dev/med/ is a place where Medell√≠n developers share knowledege, solve hard problems together and have beers.
And the web site tries to get the community together around a funny place and also lets developers from other communities
or whoever intrested in our cummunity to watch past event data as videos and that.

Oh and you can use the talk command to chat with other online devs :)
